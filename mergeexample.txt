I am doing editing on computer 1
	In the process of editing, I do believe that all will be well
	Change can be a very cathartic and rewarding experience
	
And I am also editing on computer 2
	I'm not too sure things will be well.  I remain very suspicious
	Change is volotile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. never do it. 
	
Computer 1: Cautiously optimistic about all things coming together well.  Perhaps I am wrong?
Computer 2: Hopelessly pessimistic about all things staying seperate.
