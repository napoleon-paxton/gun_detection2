I am doing editing on computer 1
	In the process of editing, I do believe that we will have to be very careful with our edits
	Change can be a very cathartic and rewarding experience, but also chaotic
	
And I am also editing on computer 2
	I'm not too sure things will be all bad.  I remain cautions but hopefull
	Change is volotile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. buckle up and lets get to it. 
	

Computer 2: Also cautiously optimistic. I could be rigth, or wrong, or both.

Computer 1: Cautiously optimistic about all things coming together well.  Perhaps I am wrong?
