### RHS First Edit 2021-01-04
Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
Satoshi Nakamoto
satoshin@gmx.com
www.bitcoin.org
Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow
online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a

financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the
main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent
double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a
peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them
into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that
cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not
only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that
it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU
power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the
network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a
best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will,
accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened
while they were gone.
